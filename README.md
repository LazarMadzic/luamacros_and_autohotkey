Run the lua script and you see output like in the image above, locate the code between two "&" signs and set device name as such.

You can also download HMI tool form luamactos website which will give you which key code you will need when you press the coresponding button.


Also you will need to set both luamacros and autohotkey to lauch on system startup.
